// Question: Suppose youâ€™re building a reservation system for a hotel. Write a constructor function Room that creates a room object with properties like roomNumber, type, price, and isAvailable. Hint: Use the new keyword to create new room objects.


function Room(roomNumber, type, price, isAvailable) {
    this.roomNumber = roomNumber;
    this.type = type;
    this.price = price;
    this.isAvailable = isAvailable;
  }
  
  Room.prototype.bookRoom = function () {
    if (this.isAvailable) {
      this.isAvailable = false;
      return `Room ${this.roomNumber} has been booked.`;
    } else {
      return `Room ${this.roomNumber} is not available.`;
    }
  };
  
  Room.prototype.releaseRoom = function () {
    this.isAvailable = true;
    return `Room ${this.roomNumber} is now available.`;
  };
  
  const room1 = new Room(101, "Deluxe", 150, true);
  const room2 = new Room(102, "Standard", 100, false);
  
  console.log(room1.bookRoom());
  console.log(room1.releaseRoom());

function Course(title, instructor, duration, studentsEnrolled) {
    this.title = title;
    this.instructor = instructor;
    this.duration = duration;
    this.studentsEnrolled = studentsEnrolled;
  }
  
  const jsCourse = new Course("JavaScript Basics", "John Doe", "4 weeks", 50);

  console.log(jsCourse.instructor);
  console.log(jsCourse.duration);
  console.log(jsCourse.studentsEnrolled);



// (3) Digital Wallet:

function Wallet(ownerName, balance, currency) {
    this.ownerName = ownerName;
    this.balance = balance;
    this.currency = currency;
  
    this.addMoney = function (amount) {
      this.balance += amount;
      console.log(
        `Added ${amount} ${this.currency}. New balance: ${this.balance} ${this.currency}.`
      );
    };
  
    this.getDetails = function () {
      console.log(
