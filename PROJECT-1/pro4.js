// Write a JavaScript code snippet that uses the compound assignment operators to perform the following operations:

// Add 15 to num
// Subtract 5 from num
// Multiply num by 3
// Divide num by 2
// Initialize num to 10, and log the result after each operation.


let num = 10;
num += 15;
num -= 5;
num *= 3;
num /= 2;
console.log("Number final value is", num);
